# Graphing-Calculator
I'll be trying to create a rudamentary graphing caclulator in a C# Console

This is a Graphing Calculator made entirely with the use of C#
Newest version has 6 different formulas you can render
- sin(x)
- cos(x)
- tan(x)
- log(x)
- sqrt(x)
- x^2

When the coordinate system appears, you will have the ability to interact with it
- WASD to move around and look at different parts of the system
- O to zoom out
- P to zoom in
- R to reset your view back to the orego
- Enter to just redraw the current setup
- F to choose which formulas to display
- C to do integral calculations
