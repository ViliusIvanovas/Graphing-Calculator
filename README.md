# Graphing-Calculator
I'll be trying to create a rudamentary graphing caclulator in a C# Console

This is a Graphing Calculator made entirely with the use of C#
Currently it is set to render 'Sin(x)'

When the coordinate system appears, you will have the ability to interact with it
    WASD to move around and look at different parts of the system
    R to reset your view back to the orego
    Enter to just redraw the current setup
